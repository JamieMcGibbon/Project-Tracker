# Project Tracker

This is a project that I started with the intent of building a project management web-app. The purpose of the app is to help developers, QA testers, and others to keep track of to-dos, QA notes, and more. Users will be able to assign various priority levels to the items in their lists, in order to better keep track of what needs to be done and when.
